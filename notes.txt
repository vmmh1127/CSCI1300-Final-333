1. display all characters and their stats 
NO BACKWARD MOVES!
2. prompt to enter name > Player 1 and Player 2

TO DO: stuff for player 2 ////////////////////////////////////

3. choose scientist character from characters.txt 
they have personal attributes > Ex, A, Ef, I, DPs
They can be chosen only once, update Menu if so 

Experience = 
Accuracy = const 100+ 
Efficiency = const 100+
Insight = const 100+
DPs = start with 20,000

4. choose path type > label paths TO DO /////////////////////////

CREATE FUNCTION FOR DPs /////////////////////////////

Training = -5000 DPs, increase A+=500; Ef+=500; I+=1000
all before game starts 
then chose an advisor > make txt file > have special powers 
on the path
QS> can we reduce the number of advisors

Direct = +5000 DPs, A+=200, Ef+=200, I+=200
more challenges in path

both paths have diff arrangement of tiles > randomise tile arrangement
QS> ISN'T THIS ALREADY DONE IN Board.cpp ???? //////////////////////////////

6. always display Main Menu, and relevant options for player

7. Create random Dice for alternating turns = done in board.cpp under public members //////////


8. Involve riddles as the challenges > purple tiles 

9. Main Menu: 
    1) Player Progress - (a)DPs (b)Trait stats
    2) character name and Ex 
    3) check position - display board //do we really need it?
    4) review advisor - if yes, use ability for challenge
    5) move forward 

STRANDS ARE VECTORS 

for the first four colors - THESE HAVE been defined in dna.cpp file
should i put it in Tile.h ?? What to put there? 

10. Blue tile - similarity score = total matches/total positions 

11. Pink - similarity but unequal length =  > have to find out how to overlap 

12. Red - mutation - three goals - 
identify substitution, insertion (extra), deletion

13. Brown - replace every 'T' with 'U' (thymine, uracil)

14. random_events.txt for the green tiles

15. When players reach orange tile - 
1) calculate total DPs
2) for every 100 in A, Ef, I > add 1000 DPs to the total DPs
3) display winner > "Player 1/2 is the Lead Genomicist"
