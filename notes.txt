Accuracy = const 100+ 
Efficiency = const 100+
Insight = const 100+
DPs = start with 20,000

4. choose path type > label paths TO DO /////////////////////////

CREATE FUNCTION FOR DPs /////////////////////////////

Training = -5000 DPs, increase A+=500; Ef+=500; I+=1000
all before game starts 
then chose an advisor > make txt file > have special powers 
on the path
QS> can we reduce the number of advisors

Direct = +5000 DPs, A+=200, Ef+=200, I+=200
more challenges in path

both paths have diff arrangement of tiles > randomise tile arrangement
QS> ISN'T THIS ALREADY DONE IN Board.cpp ???? //////////////////////////////

6. always display Main Menu, and relevant options for player
